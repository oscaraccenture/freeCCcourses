## 2\. Formal Execution & Specification Report

This template is best for compliance or when a clear, structured record of the test environment is paramount.

```
Subject: Formal Test Execution Completion - User Story [ID]

Greetings,

This report confirms the successful execution of the Test Script for **User Story [ID]** ([User Story Title]). The execution details and environmental specifications are outlined below:

---
### **Test Execution Specifications**
**Test Suite/User Story ID:** [ID]
**Execution Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Agent/Tester:** [Tester Name]
**Permission Set Used:** [e.g., Admin access / Read-Only / MMS admin role]

| Specification Detail | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Execution Environment** | [e.g., 1234Stage] |
| **System/OS** | [e.g., macOS Sonoma 14.3] |
| **Browser/Client** | [e.g., Google Chrome v120.0.6099.199] |
| **Application Version** | [Build/Version Number] |

---
### **Results and Test Clarity**
**Overall Result:** **All tests passed (100% Pass Rate).** The specified functionality is working as expected within the given parameters.
**Clarity Note:** One instruction was identified as a potential duplicate.
* **Redundancy Identified:** Test Case N [Number]: Prompts [N] and [M] are functionally the same. This does not impact the test result but should be reviewed for script optimization.

---
### **Issues Logged During Execution**
A number of known, previously reported issues were re-encountered during this test, primarily related to role-specific actions:

* **Prompting Clarity (BUG 12, BUG 123, and BUG 1234):** The system intermittently requires the full object ID (e.g., opportunity Id) in addition to the exact field name for successful field updates. This was observed on the [Specific Page/Tab, e.g., opportunity core page] after successful execution from the Home tab.
* **Single-Value Constraint (BUG 567 and BUG 5678):** When attempting to modify two fields simultaneously, especially with one invalid value, the agent received the message: **"You can update only a single value at a time..."** or **"It seems you can only update one value at a time."** Subsequent attempts to update a single field with the invalid value resulted in the field value being blanked out.
* **Known Issues Summary:** All issues reported here were encountered using the [MMS admin role] and are associated with existing tickets: **BUG 1551467, BUG 1552022, BUG 1550199, BUG 1551807, and BUG 1552266.**

Please let me know if you need any additional context or information about the execution.

Regards,
Tester

## 3\. Detailed Test Case & Anomaly Report

Use this template when you want to highlight the anomalies/bugs alongside specific test cases, focusing on the steps that reveal the issue.

```
Subject: Test Completion: [Feature/Module] - Pass Rate [X]%

Greetings,

The Test Script for **[User Story/Module Name]** has been executed successfully. Details are below, including anomalies encountered.

---
### **Test Specification & Metrics**
**Test Script:** [User Story ID/Name]
**Tested Role:** [e.g., Admin/Standard User]
**Pass Percentage:** [X]%

| Specification | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Environment** | [e.g., 1234Stage] |
| **Platform Tested** | [Specific Device/OS - e.g., iPad Pro (iOS 17.1)] |
| **Browser/App Version** | [e.g., Safari / App Build 3.1.2] |

---
### **Successful Execution Confirmation**
The tests were run **successfully**. All intended functionality passed according to the test criteria. The overall flow and critical paths are stable in the specified environment.

---
### **Test Clarity/Script Improvement Notes**
**Anomaly:** Test Case N 5 shows prompts 12 and 15 are functionally identical.
**Recommendation:** Consolidate these steps in the test script to improve efficiency.

---
### **Observed Anomalies (Bugs)**
The following issues were observed during the execution. They primarily relate to how the system handles complex or multi-step input:

**1. Field Update Ambiguity (Related to BUG 12, BUG 123, BUG 1234)**
* **Observed Behavior:** When attempting to update a field on the opportunity core page, the update often fails unless the prompt explicitly includes the opportunity ID/name in addition to the field name. This issue is intermittent and less frequent when executing the prompt from the Home tab.
* **Role/Condition:** Encountered using the **MMS admin role**.

**2. Single-Value Modification Error (Related to BUG 567, BUG 5678)**
* **Observed Behavior:** The system explicitly rejects attempts to modify two fields in one prompt, throwing the error "You can update only a single value at a time." Furthermore, if a single field is then updated with an invalid/unsupported value, the field is incorrectly blanked out instead of displaying a standard error message.
* **Observed Messages:** "You can update only a single value at a time. Please correct your prompt and try again." OR "It seems you can only update one value at a time..."

**Known Issues Note:** All reported anomalies were encountered using the MMS admin role and correspond to previously reported bugs: BUG 1551467, BUG 1552022, BUG 1550199, BUG 1551807, and BUG 1552266.

Please let me know if you require a debrief or access to the full test execution log.

Regards,
Tester

## 5\. Stakeholder-Friendly Summary Report (Focus on Success)

This template prioritizes the **success** message and frames the issues as "known technical debt" for stakeholders who are less interested in the minute technical details.

```
Subject: SUCCESS: Test Completion for [Feature Name] - Ready for Review

Greetings,

I'm pleased to report that the Test Script for **[User Story/Feature Name]** (US [ID]) has been executed successfully. The feature is performing as expected in the target environment.

---
### **Overall Status & Specification**
**Overall Result:** **PASS (100% of cases passed).**
**Tested Role:** [e.g., Admin access]
**Pass Percentage:** 100%

| Specification (Where the tests were carried out) | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Target Environment** | [e.g., 1234Stage] |
| **Testing Agent** | Gemini 2 ([Your Name]) |
| **System Configuration** | [e.g., Enterprise build on Linux environment] |

---
### **Key Observations for Clarity**
* **Script Optimization:** A minor redundancy was found in the test script: Test Case N 5 (prompts 12 and 15 are the same). This should be cleaned up in the next iteration.

---
### **Technical Anomalies (Known Issues)**
The execution uncovered several known technical behaviors when operating with the **MMS admin role**. These are not regressions but pre-existing issues we are currently tracking:

* **Prompting Requirement:** When updating fields, the system can be overly strict, sometimes requiring the full Opportunity ID even when the field name is exact (Referencing BUG 12, BUG 123, and BUG 1234).
* **Input Constraint:** The system enforces a single-value-at-a-time update rule, which is flagged via a rejection message when multiple values are attempted (Referencing BUG 567 and BUG 5678).

The full list of pre-existing bugs re-encountered is: **BUG 1551467, BUG 1552022, BUG 1550199, BUG 1551807, and BUG 1552266.**

Please confirm receipt and let me know the next steps for this feature.

Regards,
Tester
