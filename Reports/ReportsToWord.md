That's a great idea! Formatting these reports for a Word document will make them clean, professional, and easy to read.

When preparing text for a Word document, the key is to use clear headings, tables, bold text, and lists that translate well from plain text or email formatting.

Here are the ten combined report templates (five for success, five for failure) formatted for direct use in a Word document. I've used clear titles and structured elements that Word handles well.

**Issues Logged During Execution:**
A number of known, previously reported issues were re-encountered during this test:

- **Prompting Clarity (BUG 12, etc.):** The system intermittently requires the full object ID (e.g., opportunity Id) in addition to the exact field name for successful field updates.
- **Single-Value Constraint (BUG 567, etc.):** When attempting to modify two fields simultaneously, the agent received the message: **"You can update only a single value at a time..."**
- **Known Issues Summary:** All reported issues correspond to existing tickets: **BUG 1555551403411767, BUG 9552066712022, BUG 1341554560199, etc.**

---

### **Test Clarity/Script Improvement Notes**

**Tests Were Run Successfully:** Yes, the entire script completed.
**Anomaly:** Test Case N 5 shows prompts 12 and 15 are functionally identical.
**Recommendation:** Consolidate these steps in the test script to improve efficiency.

---

### **Observed Anomalies (Re-encountered Bugs)**

The following known issues were observed during the execution. They primarily relate to how the system handles complex input:

1.  **Field Update Ambiguity (Related to BUG 12, etc.):** Field updates often fail unless the prompt explicitly includes the opportunity ID/name.
2.  **Single-Value Modification Error (Related to BUG 567, etc.):** The system explicitly rejects attempts to modify two fields in one prompt, throwing the error **"You can update only a single value at a time."**

**Known Issues Note:** All reported anomalies correspond to previously reported bugs.

Please let me know if you require a debrief.
