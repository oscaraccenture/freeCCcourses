Let Hoisting
Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top and can be initialized at any time.

Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared:



When to use JavaScript const?
Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:

A new Array
A new Object
A new Function
A new RegExp












Immutable
Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).



JavaScript Objects are Mutable
Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
